## A Practical Cloud Migration Guide for Dallas Businesses

After helping dozens of Dallas companies move to the cloud, I've learned what works and what doesn't. This guide shares real-world insights to help you avoid common pitfalls.

## Is Cloud Right for Your Business?

### When Cloud Makes Sense
- Rapid growth requiring scalability
- Remote/hybrid workforce
- Aging on-premise infrastructure
- Need for disaster recovery
- Desire to reduce IT overhead

### When to Proceed Carefully
- Heavy compliance requirements
- Legacy applications
- Limited internet bandwidth
- Unique security needs

## Pre-Migration Assessment

### Current State Analysis
1. **Application Inventory**
   - What apps do you use?
   - Which are cloud-ready?
   - What needs modification?

2. **Data Classification**
   - What's sensitive?
   - What's regulated?
   - What's archived?

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - Latency sensitivity
   - Bandwidth needs
   - Availability requirements

## Migration Strategies

### The 6 R's of Cloud Migration

1. **Rehost** ("Lift and Shift")
   - Fastest approach
   - Minimal changes
   - Limited cloud benefits

2. **Replatform** ("Lift and Optimize")
   - Some modifications
   - Better cloud utilization
   - Moderate effort

3. **Repurchase** (Replace with SaaS)
   - Move to cloud-native solutions
   - Often best for common applications
   - Reduces maintenance burden

4. **Refactor** (Re-architect)
   - Maximum cloud benefits
   - Significant effort
   - Best for core applications

5. **Retire** (Decommission)
   - Eliminate unnecessary systems
   - Reduce complexity
   - Save costs

6. **Retain** (Keep on-premise)
   - For systems not ready for cloud
   - Compliance requirements
   - Technical limitations
